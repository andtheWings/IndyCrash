    "## Background\n",
    "\n",
    "Excerpt from the IndyCrash [project wiki](https://osf.io/hr7kz/wiki/home/):\n",
    "\n",
    ">Hi, my name's Dan, I'm a resident pediatrician in Indianapolis. Several years ago, my good friend Mike was bicycling through the streets of Philadelphia when a car T-boned him after it ran a red light. Mike shattered the tip of his right elbow and his head struck straight into the windshield. He likely would not have survived if he had not been wearing a helmet. He spent months recovering from complex orthopedic surgery with physical rehab.\n",
    ">\n",
    ">I love bicycling/walking (aka active mobility). It’s a great way to build exercise into the daily routine while reducing your carbon footprint. But Mike's experience underscores why many people don't engage in active transportation--they don't feel safe on our streets. I want that to change.\n",
    ">\n",
    ">This project's goal is to rebuild the environment of streets in Indy. We will engage community members around the city to design interventions for the highest risk regions to pedestrians/bicyclists. Then we'll use randomized controlled trials to test what helps protect people with the best efficacy and dollar efficiency.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Intro\n",
    "\n",
    "This preliminary notebook will demonstrate a method for building the datasets to be used for this project. The data is derived from files made publically available from the ARIES database maintained by [Indiana State Police](https://hub.mph.in.gov/dataset/aries-crash-data-2007-2017):\n",
    "\n",
    ">The Automated Reporting Information Exchange System (ARIES) is the State of Indiana’s crash repository. Crash data is generated through first responder crash reports and collected within ARIES. Data is available for 2007 to [2019]. Examples of this data include crash details such as, vehicle information, road conditions, crash severity, weather conditions, location, date, and time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sidenote: If you are familiar with the process of data ingestion, you may be wondering why I am not using the API on the ARIES website to run more targetted queries rather than downloading each individual file. Unfortunately, the API only reliably works for half of the datasets without returning an error, so I decided it was more important to have complete data rather than a more efficient process.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Part 1: Load and combine the data\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's start by prepping the needed R libraries."

    "Throughout this project we will need an easy way to know if each observation was involved in an \"active crash\" that involved modes of active mobility like walking or bicycling.\n",
    "\n",
    "You will see that the preexisting \"person type description\" marks each observation of a person by how they were getting around. Two of the options include \"Pedal Cyclist\" or \"Pedestrian\". Additionally, the \"collision event description\" variable also sometimes says that a \"Pedestrian\" or \"Bicyclist\" was hit. Our new variables will combine both of these sources of information.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's important to note here that right now we are marking at the observational level of each individual person-- aka whether each individual was either themself using active mobility or they directly hit somebody using active mobility. I am explicitly clarifying this, because below we will be making a separate table that stores data at the observational level of each crash, which will try and encompass what we know about every person involved in that particular crash.\n",
